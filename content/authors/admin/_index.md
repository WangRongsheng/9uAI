I am currently pursuing my graduate degree in MPU, Big Data and Internet of Things. My research area is Medical AI, specifically breast ultrasound image analysis, and the construction of LLMs related to medical applications.

Prior to this, I have been actively involved in project development, data competitions, application innovation contests, and contributing to open-source communities. Recently, I have become a PaddlePaddle Developers Expert in the Baidu PaddlePaddle AI developer community.

I am particularly interested in research areas such as medical image fusion, 2D/3D image segmentation, lightweight object detection, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, model optimization for cloud-edge deployment, transfer learning, and LLMs. Additionally, I also enjoy exploring the integration of artificial intelligence with other fields, including but not limited to healthcare and transportation. My vision is to go beyond papers and ensure that algorithms are practically implemented.
